# Day 2

### Today I explored these topics in week 2 of cs50.

- characters
- strings


#### Important stuff

- One thing I newly learned about strings that a string is an array of characters which is end up by a null character to identify that a string has ended 
- Null character = `\0`
- One thing I learned that C opens our hands to control many things what we are doing, but in languages in like python much stuff is not in our hands.
